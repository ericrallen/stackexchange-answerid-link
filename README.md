stackexchange-answerid-link
===========================

A Google Chrome extension that allows you to copy a direct link to an Answer on any StackExchange site

Now available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-stack-exchange-url-w/pdnbneamjemojcmdkdgacepegbnjoamg).

Usage
=====

I often find myself borrowing and modifying code snippets from StackOverflow or other StackExchange sites, and always like to attribute the code to it's source.

It helps anyone else who looks at my code, gives credit where it's due, and serves as a reference for me when I come back to it.

I've found that sometimes it's hard to remember which answer you were looking at and sometimes the accepted answer changes, or someone posted better code after the fact, etc. so I would always open my web inspector and add "#[answer HTML id here]" to the url when I pasted it into my comment.

This extension gives you a link above every answer that you can click to automatically copy your code to the clipboard.
